## What is Defi Kingdom? A DEX, a CEX, a game or NFT platform? I'm confused.
DeFi Kingdoms is a gamified DEX with liquidity pools, and a market of utility driven NFTs, all seamlessly rolled into an interactive and immersive platform built around a nostalgic form of fantasy pixel art game. 
##

## Where do I create Liquidity pools (LP) to deposit the crypto currency of my choice? 
To provide liquidity you need the governance token of the game which is JEWEL.
Go to the “Marketplace”, click on the "TRADER" to Trade/Swap the token of your choice for JEWEL. 
To join a Liquidity Pool; go to garden and add liquidity. You need to provide equal value of both tokens; example 100$ of ONE and 100$ of Jewel. Then proceed to stake your liquidity in the pool of choice.

## I'm curious to know what is the point in using the bank when there are Liquidity Pools in the gardens?
Bank earns fees from every in-game transaction like trading, so you get more JEWELs than what you originally put in. From Phase 2 onwards the bank will also receive fees from other in-game transactions, such as from summoning heroes, buying land, etc. The latest/current ratio of XJEWEL:JEWEL is available with the Teller NPC in the bank.

Apart from insulating you from possible Impermanent loss (This happens when the price of your tokens changes compared to when you deposited them in the pool), the exchange rate of xJEWEL will ALWAYS keep increasing. This means you are guaranteed higher returns on you bank deposits the longer you keep it there.

Consider this hypothetical scenario: 
You deposit 100 JEWEL in the bank when the bank rate was at 1.00 xJEWEL = 1.00 JEWEL exchange value. 
After 1 month, if 1 xJEWEL = 1.30 JEWEL becomes the new exchange rate; you will now get 130 JEWEL on withdrawal for the 100 JEWEL you had initially deposited.
After 2 months, if 1 xJEWEL = 1.75 JEWEL becomes the new exchange rate; you will now get 175 JEWEL on withdrawal for the same 100 JEWEL you had initially deposited.
## 
 
## Should I claim and withdraw my rewards from the bank, then deposit them back to compound my rewards or does that happen automatically?
You do not need to claim and re-deposit in the case of the bank. The xJEWEL in the bank increases based on the current rate displayed by the Bank Teller. This will be realized automatically when you finally withdraw.
But you do need to claim and redeposit rewards into liquidity pools (LP) for compounding. LP rewards are not auto compounded.
## 

## Under the Locking Model, what does it mean that lock-unlocked reward calculation only takes effect once you click claim? Can I wait till until week 51 to unlock 100%?
The locked and unlocked percentage are calculated at the instance you Claim them from the Garden. You can theroetically leave the rewards unclaimed till week 51 and then claim the full or 100% of the rewards in an unlocked state. 
Consider this hypothetical scenario with 100 JEWELs being eligible for rewards at any given point of time (**not considering APR%, multipliers or an increase in rewards): 
You go to the garden and see that you have 100 JEWEL Reward ready to claim. 
If you are in week 1 of the Lock Model you would get 5 unlocked and 95 locked JEWEL.
If you are in week 2 of the Lock Model you would get 7 unlocked and 93 locked JEWEL.
If you are in week 7 of the Lock Model you would get 13 unlocked and 87 locked JEWEL.
If you are in week 51 of the Lock Model you would receive all 100 JEWEL in unlocked form.
 
Do note that due to an in-built feature of the DEX code, every time you add/supply tokens to your existing liquidity pool, it will automatically trigger the Claim Reward action.
## 
 

## How does the withdrawal fees clock of the Liquidity Pool work? Does the timer reset every time I deposit more liquidity?
The withdrawal timer starts from the original LP deposit. This will ONLY reset after a withdrawal. So, you can keep on adding without removing from the pool and get past the withdrawal penalties.
##  
 
## I am curious about the safety of my JEWEL here from hackers. How secure is the platform?
All the in-game tokens (including your own) are secured currently through a multi-sig wallet at multisig.harmony.one that is controlled by 4 founding members of the project. Any transaction will require 3 out of 4 signatures to execute thereby protecting against hacks targeting the treasuries, as there is no single point of failure. Additionally, this protects against any one member of the team having the power to do anything on their, without the rest of the team being aware of and agreeing to it.

## Is there an audit done or planned?
We do 100% code coverage with unit tests, as well as run it against a couple of automated solidity auditing programs that scan for vulnerabilities. The final step is hiring a professional solidity auditor and that is in the works.
